StackStorm is a powerful open-source event-driven automation platform written in Python with a mission to solve modern development, operations and system integration challenges.
We can tie together out existing infrastructure and application environment using StackStorm.
 So that we can more easily automate that environment - with a particular focus on taking actions in response to events. 
So, StackStorm is like IFTTT (If-This-Than-That) tool for DevOps and Infrastructure.
Suppose, if you don't want to wait for events, then youcan schedule tasks to run like cron jobs.
We can also execute tasks manually using StackStorm web UI, CLI and API’s.
Here, API’s are the  key feature of StackStorm because using API’s we can easily integrate external applications with StackStorm.
