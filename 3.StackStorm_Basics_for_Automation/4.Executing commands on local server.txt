Executing commands/scripts is nothing but executing actions.
Actions are always with respect to packs only.

We have two pre-installed / default packs to Execute Some of the basic Linux Commands on Local or remote server.
They are:
	Core 
	Linux 
=================================
Procedure is same to execute actions on local or remote server. 
Only Difference is input parameters.
Example:
	We don’t need username and password to execute an action locally.
	We need username and password to execute an action remotely.
Note: Here username and password are the input paramterts.  


They are two commands/ways to execute an action on local or remote server.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
st2 action execute pack.action  <required_paramters>
	Note: It is like scheduling an action.
st2 run pack.action <required_parameters>
        Note: We have to wait on our command line until to finish the an action


How to get execution history ?
------------------------------
 st2 execution list

How to see the result of execution action if we know execution id ?

  st2 execution get <execution_id>

How to tail the log  of execution action if we know execution id ?
  st2 execution tail <execution_id>
