We have two types of CLIs on StackStorm Server.
===============================================
st2       -->  For User Automation
st2ctl   -->  For StackStorm Administration

Important paths:
===============
/opt/stackstorm
/etc/st2
 /var/log/st2 
Python Version is used by StackStorm
Remove .st2 folder under root home or from where we ran quick install script.

Need to change the password? 
---------------------------
Run: sudo htpasswd /etc/st2/htpasswd st2admin

st2 login is valid for 24hours
      Because st2 login uses api token to validate credentials with stackstorm.
