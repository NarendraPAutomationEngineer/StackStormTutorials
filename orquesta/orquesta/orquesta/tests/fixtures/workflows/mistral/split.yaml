    description: >
        A basic workflow that demonstrate a split use case where a non-join task
        is referenced in more than one task transitions. The workflow is hence
        split into multiple branches from the non-join task.
    tasks:
        task1:
            action: std.noop
            on-success:
                - task2
                - task3

        # branch 1
        task2:
            action: std.noop
            on-success:
                - task4

        # branch 2
        task3:
            action: std.noop
            on-success:
                - task4

        # split branch
        task4:
            action: std.noop
            on-success:
                - task5
                - task6
        task5:
            action: std.noop
            on-success:
                - task7
        task6:
            action: std.noop
            on-success:
                - task7
        task7:
            join: all
            action: std.noop
