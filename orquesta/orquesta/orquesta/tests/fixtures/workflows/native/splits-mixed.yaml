  A basic workflow that demonstrate a split use case where a non-join task
  is referenced in more than one task transitions. The workflow is hence
  split into multiple branches from the non-join task. Additional splits
  occur at task transitions.

tasks:
  task1:
    action: core.noop
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        do: task3
  task2:
    action: core.noop
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        do: task3

  # split from single task transition in a task
  task3:
    action: core.noop
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        do: task4
      - when: <% failed() %>
        do: task4

  # split from multiple task transition in a task
  task4:
    action: core.noop
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        do: task5
  task5:
    action: core.noop
