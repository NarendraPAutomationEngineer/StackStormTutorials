  A basic workflow that demonstrate a split use case where a non-join task
  is referenced in more than one task transitions. The workflow is hence
  split into multiple branches from the non-join task.

tasks:
  task1:
    action: core.noop
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        do: task2, task3

  # branch 1
  task2:
    action: core.noop
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        do: task4

  # branch 2
  task3:
    action: core.noop
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        do: task4

  # split branch
  task4:
    action: core.noop
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        do: task5, task6
  task5:
    action: core.noop
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        do: task7
  task6:
    action: core.noop
    next:
      - when: <% succeeded() %>
        do: task7
  task7:
    join: all
    action: core.noop
