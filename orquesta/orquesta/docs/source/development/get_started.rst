Coding Style
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We follow `PEP8 Python Style Guide <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.
* We use the `hacking <https://pypi.org/project/hacking/>`_ flake8 plugins for additional checks
  and additional flake8 plugins are located under ``./orquesta/tests/hacking``.
* Use 4 spaces for a tab.
* Use 100 characters in a line.
* Make sure edited files don't contain any trailing whitespace.
* Make sure that all the source files contain an Apache 2.0 license header.
  See an existing python file for example.
* Be consistent with existing style of the file(s) being edited.
* Run ``tox -epep8`` to ensure code changes don't break any style rules.


Running Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the root of the project directory, run the command ``tox`` to run all the unit tests for various
python versions, run pep8 to check code styles, and check docs for errors. The configuration for
tox is located in the ``tox.ini`` file. Alternatively, individual environments can be run by
passing the ``-e`` arg.  For example, the command ``tox -epy36`` runs the python 3.6 unit tests and
the command ``tox -epep8`` runs the pylint and flake8 checks.

It is possible to run a single unit test or tests within a single test module. Let use the test
module ``./orquesta/tests/unit/conducting/test_workflow_conductor.py`` as an example. The following
is examples for creating the python virtualenv and running either all the tests in a module or
running only a single test within the module.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Make and activate the virtualenv.
    $ make venv
    $ . ./.venv/bin/activate

    # Run all the tests in module ./orquesta/tests/unit/conducting/test_workflow_conductor.py.
    $ python -m unittest orquesta.tests.unit.conducting.test_workflow_conductor

    # Run a single test such as test_init in the WorkflowConductorTest class.
    $ python -m unittest orquesta.tests.unit.conducting.test_workflow_conductor.WorkflowConductorTest.test_init
